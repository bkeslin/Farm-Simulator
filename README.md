# Farm-Simulator
Simple Farm Planning Simulation with Monte Carlo Tree Search.

This program decides whether to plant Beans or Corn on each spot in a farm, using Monte Carlo Tree Search. The rules around the plants are that for each Bean adjacent to a given Corn crop its production goes up by one, and for a Bean the production rises by 5 if there is one or more Corn crop adjacent to it.
